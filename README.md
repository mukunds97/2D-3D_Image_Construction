# 2D-3D_Medical_Image_Construction

In this project, we compared various hand-crafted image processing algorithms such as SIFT, SURF, ORB, and AKAZE used for feature detection and mapping that play a crucial role in improving the accuracy of the 3D conversion of medical images. We used Computed Tomography (CT) scan data of the pancreas to study algorithms, compared them on multiple parameters, and it was observed that ensembling multiple algorithms provide a 3D construc- tion with improved accuracy for medical imaging.
